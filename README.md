PHP AES CryptoJS
================

AES Encryption/Decryption between PHP server and CryptoJS 3.x client

FEATURES
--------

It's a simple implementation of handing encryption and decryption with AES symmetric-key algorithm between two side, PHP server and Javascript client. 

---

CONCEPTION
----------

[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), a subset of the Rijndael cipher, which is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.

### Block cipher mode of operation

- ECB - Same cipher text with same plain text. No use of IV.

- CBC - Different cipher text with same plain text. Using IV. (The most commonly used mode of operation)
